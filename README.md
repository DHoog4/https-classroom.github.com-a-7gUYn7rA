This lab was useful and essential, and a good continuation for me, since I (Dan Hoogasian) created a Git account awhile back for work, but have never used it.
I am relatively tech savvy, but still had substation issues with this lab.
It was harder than it should have been for me. Maybe my computer had some issues.
Whatever the case, it is done, though through the unideal GitHub Desktop and probably not in the recommended way.
