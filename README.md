This lab was useful and essential, and a good continuation for me, since I (Dan Hoogasian or DHoog4 on GitHub) created a Git account awhile back for work, but have never used it.
Part 3 involved setting up a GitHub account and a Git client, and accepting the first assignment as a repository in my Git account. Then I cloned the assignment locally to my HD. Then I saved it as a readme.md file and pushed it to Gradescope. I did this through the less than ideal GitHub Desktop and probably not in the recommended way.
Part 1 was just using Python on Jupyter Notebook to solve some simply programming equations.
Part 2 was setting up just one simple Python program on PyCharm.
I am relatively tech savvy, but still had substation issues with this lab. Maybe my computer had some issues. Whatever the case, I probably spent 15 hours on this, which I think is longer than expected.
